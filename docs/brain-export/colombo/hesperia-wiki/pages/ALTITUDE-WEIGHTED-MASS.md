# ALTITUDE_WEIGHTED_MASS

**Status:** 🟢 LIVE_FULL — matches proposal (if any), running in production path  
**Category:** [Graph and Structural Metrics](../categories/Graph-and-Structural-Metrics.md)  
**Type:** Derived variable  
**Responsible (module):** `core/layers/layer_1.py::compute_L1 -> result["ALTITUDE_WEIGHTED_MASS"]`  
**Value / default:** float >=0

## In plain words

Total activation mass weighted by how deep/specific each hit was, summed across every family that was touched.

## Definition

- **Receives:** [L1 — Structural Activation Census](../pages/L1-Structural-Activation-Census.md)
- **Does:** sum(hits[f] * mean_altitude[f] for hit families)
- **Outputs:** `float >=0` → *no named wiki consumer yet*
- **Exists for:** L1 census field — first pipeline layer every later layer reads

## Yields (formula)

sum(hits[f] * mean_altitude[f] for hit families)

## Produced from (inputs)

- [L1 — Structural Activation Census](../pages/L1-Structural-Activation-Census.md)

## Origin

Hesperia-native `34_SPEC` L1 instrumentation — no Java prototype ancestor for the L1-L9 layer pipeline as a whole — Theory Explainer: plain_lang: Total activation mass weighted by how deep/specific each hit was, summed across every family that was touched.. author: Hesperia L1 (34_SPEC / output_catalog §1). extent: full. reasoning: L1 census field — first pipeline layer every later layer reads. application: [L1 — Structural Activation Census](../pages/L1-Structural-Activation-Census.md), L2–L9.
